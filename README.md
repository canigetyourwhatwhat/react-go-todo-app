# react-go-todo-app
First simple todo app that uses backend for Go and Frontend for React

# To start

Run backend server
- `make dev` on the **backend** directory will run the back-end server on port 8080


Run forntend server
- go to **front** directory
- `yarn install' to install all the dependencies
- `yarn start' to run the front-end server on port 3000


Now, the app is running.


## To keep in mind

This app needs to refresh every time when there is any change made. 
For example, when you created new To-do, you need to click the refresh botton to update fron-end.
This issue will be fixed on the next version...
